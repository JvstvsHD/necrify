/**
 * An interface used to retrieve player names und uuids used for storing them in a database.
 * To retrieve a player's uuid, for example, there are three different ways:<br>
 * 1.: {@link #getPlayerUuid(String)}: returns the uuid of the player via {@link Optional} or {@link Optional#empty()} if this player is not online/cached/etc.<br>
 * 2.: {@link #queryPlayerUuid(String, Executor)} queries the player uuid via the mojang api or some internal methods.<br>
 * 3.: {@link #getOrQueryPlayerName(UUID, Executor)}: a combination of the first two possibilities. If the Optional returned by {@link #getPlayerUuid(String)} was empty,
 * {@link #getOrQueryPlayerUuid(String, Executor)} is called. The result of this operation will be returned.
 * @deprecated This interface's functionality will be superseded by the new
 * <a href="https://github.com/users/JvstvsHD/projects/5/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=65367115">NecrifyUser</a>.
